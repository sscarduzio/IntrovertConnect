## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/introconnect

# Session
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

# Email (optional)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
```

## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Running Locally

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the PostgreSQL database**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d db
   ```

   > **Note**: The Docker configuration uses `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust` for easier local development.

3. **Set up environment variables (Optional)**
   The default configuration should work out of the box, but if you need to customize:
   ```
   # Database (Optional - hardcoded defaults used by server/db.ts)
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/introconnect
   
   # Session
   SESSION_SECRET=dev_session_secret
   
   # For development (prevents email errors)
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.dummy_key_for_dev
   ```

4. **Run database migrations**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000

### Troubleshooting Database Connection
The application will use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable if available. If not, it falls back to hardcoded development credentials:

```javascript
// If DATABASE_URL is defined, it uses that
// Otherwise it falls back to these parameters:
{
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 5432,
  database: 'introconnect',
  user: 'postgres',
  password: 'postgres'
}
```

If you experience database connection issues like `SASL: SCRAM-SERVER-FIRST-MESSAGE: client password must be a string`, try setting the `DATABASE_URL` directly in your environment or add it to your `.env` file with one of these formats:

```
# Option 1
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/introconnect

# Option 2
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/introconnect
```

## üìä Database Schema

IntroConnect uses a relational database with the following core tables:

| Table            | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| users            | User accounts with authentication credentials    |
| contacts         | Contact details with relationship metrics        |
| tags             | Categories for organizing contacts               |
| contact_tags     | Junction table for contact-tag relationships     |
| contact_logs     | Record of interactions with contacts             |
| calendar_events  | Events and meetups scheduled with contacts       |

## üìù Usage

1. **Register/Login**: Create an account to access the system
2. **Add Contacts**: Enter contact details and set reminder frequencies
3. **Organize with Tags**: Create custom tags to categorize your contacts
4. **Log Interactions**: Record each meaningful interaction
5. **Schedule Events**: Create calendar events for future meetups
6. **Monitor Relationships**: Check the dashboard for relationship health metrics
7. **Receive Reminders**: Get email notifications when it's time to reconnect
